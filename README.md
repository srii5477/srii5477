### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi! I am Sridevi, a computer science engineering student passionate about all things coding, software development, data science and ML. I am  working on several projects practicing what I learn and I am open to collaboration. I am also eager for discussions and interactions from fellow coders, and I wish to learn as much as possible from everyone.
